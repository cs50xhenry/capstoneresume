    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I created this website as a personal goal to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I am dedicating at least 3-4 hours per weekday to accomplish this goal.</p>
        <p>My background in HTML started in high school when I took an "Introduction to Web Development" class. Creating websites from scratch and learning how to use HTML on my Xanga account gave me a sense of accomplishment however over 90% of my classmates excelled faster than I did. I was always embarrassed to show my work on the projector screen in my class because I knew I was never a great student and my grades were always mediocre.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to today, I'm 34 with three children and a beautiful partner, and I still find myself interested in learning how to code. I purchased a few Udemy courses to help me learn the fundamentals of Full Stack Development, Python, and SwiftOS. I'm hoping that when I complete the courses, I will have the skillset to create the apps and ideas that come to mind (I have a handful of "million dollar ideas") </p>
        <p>Wish me luck on my journey :)</p>
